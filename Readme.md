libbsdcompat provides a collection of functions
traditionally found in BSD libc implementations,
intended to improve source and binary compatibility
on systems using the standard C library.

The library contains code under permissive,
GPL-compatible licenses (BSD 3-Clause, ISC, and CC0)
and is suitable for inclusion in the base system
and general use by third-party software.
